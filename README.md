# -DistributedSystems-Project-2021
A NTUA project for the Distributed Systems course 

This project is an design of a ToyChord, a simpler version of Chord, as described in [Stoica, Ion, et al. "Chord: A scalable peer-to-peer lookup service for internet applications." ACMSIGCOMM Computer Communication Review 31.4 (2001): 149-160).](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/964723.383071). 

It is a file sharing application that utilizes many distributed nodes DHT. Every node performs every DHT operation. This involves interactions with Chord either as a server or as a client, opening sockets and aswering requests.
